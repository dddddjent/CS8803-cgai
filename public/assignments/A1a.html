    Assignment 1A: Signed Distance Field and Ray Marching
</h1>

<p class="mb-4">
    Welcome to our journey through Computer Graphics in the AI Era! In the first assignment, we will explore the beauty of light and shape with our new friend, the signed distance function (SDF), by implementing SDF representations together with a ray marching pipeline within GLSL shaders. This will include realistic lighting, shading, and complex implicit shapes. Your task is to implement a comprehensive set of SDF primitives, Boolean operations, normal calculations, and the ray marching algorithm, as well as to create a compelling scene. Let’s get started!

<h2 class="h2-custom">Requirements</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
For this assignment, you are expected to implement six components to render SDF with an ray marching framework: <em>SDF primitives</em>, <em>boolean operations</em>, <em>scene composition</em>, <em>ray marching</em>, <em>normal calculation</em>, and <em>shading and coloring</em>. We will briefly discuss each step as follows.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 1: SDF Primitives</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
You are required to implement SDF primitives for basic shapes: spheres, planes, and boxes. Each function calculates the signed distance from a query point to the shape’s surface. The sphere is defined by its center and radius, the plane by its height along the y-axis, and the box by its center and half-size. 
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 2: Boolean Operations</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
You are tasked with implementing boolean operations for SDFs: union, intersection, and subtraction. Union takes the minimum of two distances, intersection takes the maximum, and subtraction inverts one shape before intersecting. These operations allow combining shapes into complex objects for the next steps.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 3: Scene SDF</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you are tasked with constructing the scene's SDF using the implemented primitive functions and boolean operations. The goal is to combine different objects, such as spheres, boxes, and planes, using the CSG operations. You will also need to position these objects appropriately in the scene according to the shape parameters pre-specified for each object. The final SDF function should return the minimum distance to any surface in the scene.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 4: Ray Marching</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you are asked to implement the ray marching algorithm to render the SDF scene. Ray marching involves stepping along a ray starting from the camera position until it either intersects an object (determined by a small distance threshold) or exits the scene bounds. For each step, you will calculate the distance to the nearest surface using the SDF function and accumulate this distance until a hit or termination condition is met.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 5: Normal Calculation</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you will calculate the surface normal at a given point using the finite difference method. By sampling the SDF function at nearby points, you can estimate the gradient of the SDF, which corresponds to the surface normal. The computed normal will be used in the Phong shading model to calculate color on each implicit surface.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 6: Lighting and Coloring</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you are asked to color the objects to achieve realistic lighting effects. You are also tasked to assign a unique color to each object in the scene based on its position or type. <em>We do not ask for a perfect match of our given video. You may pick any color you like for the rendering of these four objects. Here the only requirement is the four objects must have different colors, and each object must have a single color.</em>

Note that we have already implemented a standard Phong shading model as well as the shadows using the same ray marching algorithm for you to determine if a surface point is occluded from the light source or not. So once you have implemented your ray-marching algorithm, you should be able to observe lighting effects as shown in the video below.

<h2 class="h2-custom">Creative Expression</h2>
In the Creative Expression section of this assignment, you are encouraged to create your own SDF scene by leveraging our ray marching framework. You are permitted to reuse the 3D SDF functions implemented in IQ's 3D SDF list (refer to the links above) and integrate them into your shader to serve your creative expression goals, provided that you specify the link and function name before each reused function. We expect your Creative Expression SDF scene to depict objects or animations that are challenging to model using a standard mesh-based renderer. The creative expression theme for this assignment is <strong>A Blobby World</strong>.

<h2 class="h2-custom">Grading</h2>
<p>This assignment is worth a total of 8 points, with the grading criteria outlined as follows:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
    <li>
        <strong>Technical Contribution (6 points):</strong> The core of the grading is based on the correct implementation of noise functions. The distribution of points is as follows:
